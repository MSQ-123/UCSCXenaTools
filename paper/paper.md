# Summary

UCSC Xena is a visual exploration resource for both public and private omics data, supported through the web-based Xena Browser and multiple turn-key Xena Hubs. This unique archecture allows researchers to view their own data securely, using private Xena Hubs, simultaneously visualizing large public cancer genomics datasets, including TCGA and the GDC. Data integration occurs only within the Xena Browser, keeping private data private. Xena supports virtually any functional genomics data, including SNVs, INDELs, large structural variants, CNV, expression, DNA methylation, ATAC-seq signals, and phenotypic annotations. Browser features include the Visual Spreadsheet, survival analyses, powerful filtering and subgrouping, statistical analyses, genomic signatures, and bookmarks. Xena differentiates itself from other genomics tools, including its predecessor, the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, by its ability to easily and securely view public and private data, its high performance, its broad data type support, and many unique features.
