A R package download and explore data from **UCSC Xena data hubs**, which are

> A collection of UCSC-hosted public databases such as TCGA, ICGC, TARGET, GTEx, CCLE, and others. Databases are normalized so they can be combined, linked, filtered, explored and downloaded.

I will develop how to easily download and analyze data from these data hubs. I am not familiar with API, much work need to do.
